# Questions Lab5
1. Write a Python program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. 

2. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generates a list and a tuple which contains every number. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program.

3. Write a Python program that calculates and prints the value accordingly to the given   
**Formula:** Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H].  
***Following are the fixed values of C and H:***  
*C is 50, H is 30. D is the variable whose values should be input to your program on a comma-separated sequence.*  
**Example:** Let us assume the following comma-separated input sequence is given to the program: 100,150,180.  
**The output of the program should be:** 18,22,24.

4. Write a Python program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
**Input:** without, hello, bag, world  
**Output:** bag, hello, without, world

5. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma-separated sequence.  
***Example:** 0100,0011,1010,1001.*  
***Then the output:** 1010.*  
***Notes:** Assume the data is input by the console.*  
***Hints:** In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.*

6. Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based on a transaction log from console input.  
**The transaction log format is shown as following:**  
*D 100*  
*W 200*  
*D means deposit while W means withdrawal.*	

7. You are required to write a Python program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console.  
**The sort criteria is:**  
***1:** Sort based on name;*  
***2:** Then sort based on age;*  
***3:** Then sort by score;*  

*The priority is that name > age > score.*  

***If the following tuples are given as input to the program:***  
*Tom, 19, 80*  
*John, 20, 90*  
*Jony, 17, 91*  
*Jony, 17, 93*  
*Json, 21, 85*  
**Then the output of the program should be:**  
*[(‘John’, ‘20’, ‘90’), (‘Jony’, ‘17’, ‘91’), (‘Jony’, ‘17’, ‘93’), (‘Json’, ‘21’, ‘85’), (‘Tom’, ‘19’, ‘80’)]*  
</br>
***We use itemgetter to enable multiple sort keys.***

8. A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move towards UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:  
*UP 5*  
*DOWN 3*  
*LEFT 3*  
*RIGHT 2*  

*The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.*  

**Example:**  
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:   
UP 5  
DOWN 3  
LEFT 3  
RIGHT 2  
**Then, the output of the program should be:**  2   

9. Write a Python program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should after sorting the key alphanumerically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
**Input:**  
*New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.*   

*Then, the **output** should be:*  
2: 2  
3.: 1  
3?: 1  
New: 1  
Python: 5  
Read: 1  
and: 1  
between: 1  
choosing: 1  
or: 2  
to: 1
