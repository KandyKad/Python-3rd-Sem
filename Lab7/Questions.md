9. A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

**Following are the criteria for checking the password:**  
**1.** At least 1 letter between [a-z].  
**2.** At least 1 number between [0-9].  
**3.** At least 1 letter between [A-Z].  
**4.** At least 1 character from [$#@].  
**5.** Minimum length of transaction password: 6.  
**6.** Maximum length of transaction password: 12.  

Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them accordingly to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed each separated by a comma.  

**Example:**  
**If the following passwords are given as input to the program:**   
ABd1234@1, a F1#, 2w3E*, 2We3345
